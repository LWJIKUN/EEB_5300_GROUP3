# **Introduction**

In animals, eusociality is a complex and extreme social structure defined by having three characteristics: reproductive division of labor (castes), cooperative care of young, and overlapping generations (Wilson and Hölldobler, 2005). In these societies, some individuals forgo personal reproduction to help rear the offspring of genetic relatives, a scenario often explained by inclusive fitness or kin selection theory (Eberhard, 1975). Inclusive fitness posits that genes promoting behavior that increases the number of offspring of close genetic kins can spread (Eberhard, 1975). Kin selection, a kind of selection that favors a trait due to its positive effects on the reproductive success of kins, is therefore regarded as a primary mechanism enabling the evolution of eusociality (Eberhard, 1975).

Eusocial insects mainly occur in the orders Hymenoptera and Blattodea (Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990; Ross and Matthew, 2018; Thorne, 1997). Within Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), eusociality has evolved multiple times: many bees and wasps are eusocial, and all ants are eusocial (Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990; Ross and Matthew, 2018). In Blattodea, termites are eusocial cockroaches and live in large colonies with a queen, king, sterile workers, and soldiers (Thorne, 1997). By contrast, typical cockroaches lack the three characteristics of eusociality (Bell et al., 2007). Therefore, eusocial Blattodea (termites) form true colonies with castes, whereas non-social Blattodea (cockroaches) do not.

Insect eusociality depends critically on chemical communication. Social insects use pheromones and other odorant cues to recognize nestmates, mark trails, regulate caste behavior, and coordinate many aspects of colony life (Zhou et al., 2015). In the sensilla of antennae, odorant receptors (ORs) are membrane proteins in the olfactory sensory neurons that detect volatile compounds (Steinbrecht, 2007; Zhou et al., 2015). Each OR is tuned to specific chemicals, and OR signals are processed in the brain’s antennal lobes, and notably, ORs are essential for sensing chemical cues from nestmates and castes (Steinbrecht, 2007; Zhou et al., 2015). Because chemosensation is so central to eusocial behavior, sophisticated OR repertoires have been hypothesized to underpin social life (Zhou et al., 2015).

Building on this idea, genomic studies found that some eusocial insects possess very large OR gene families. For example, sequenced ant and honeybee genomes revealed some of the largest OR repertoires known in insects. Zhou et al. (2015) reported widespread chemoreceptor gene expansions in ants and bees and suggested that these expansions likely facilitated the transition to eusociality. In particular, certain OR subfamilies (such as the 9-exon subfamily) are greatly expanded in ants and social bees and have been proposed to mediate kin recognition and pheromone communication in eusocial Hymenoptera (Zhou et al., 2015). This led to the expectation that eusocial species might in general maintain more OR genes than non-social relatives.

However, recent broad comparisons challenge the simple link between eusociality and OR gene count. Gautam et al. (2024) found no evidence to support that OR repertoires in Hymenoptera are linked to the evolution of eusociality. Instead, being wingless might shape the expansion of OR genes. Thus, the relationship between OR gene family size and eusocial lifestyle remains an open question. Furthermore, few studies have tackled the OR gene count in eusocial Blattodea, and it is unclear whether eusociality in this order is also associated with relatively large OR gene repertoires.

# Research Question, Hypothesis, and Objective

**Research question: Is there a correlation between the number of odorant receptor (OR) genes and eusociality in Hymenoptera and Blattodea?**

To answer our research question, we compare OR gene counts across Hymenoptera and Blattodea. 

We hypothesize that eusocial taxa will exhibit larger OR repertoires across 19 OR subfamilies than non-eusocial taxa. 

## Study System
To explore the relationship between odorant receptor (OR) gene repertoires and eusociality, we selected representative species from four focal categories:
- **Eusocial Hymenoptera**
- **Non-eusocial Hymenoptera**
- **Eusocial Blattodea (termites, formerly order Isoptera)**
- **Non-eusocial Blattodea (cockroaches)**

An outgroup species from Odonata was also included for comparative purposes. Species were chosen based on the availability of high-quality annotated proteomes.

| **Category**               | **Species**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Eusocial Hymenoptera      | *Apis mellifera* (Western honeybee)<br>*Harpegnathos saltator* (jumping ant)<br>*Vespa crabro* (European hornet) |
| Non-eusocial Hymenoptera  | *Nasonia vitripennis* (jewel wasp)<br>*Microplitis demolitor* (braconid parasitoid wasp)<br>*Orussus abietinus* (parasitic wood wasp) |
| Eusocial Blattodea        | *Zootermopsis nevadensis* (dampwood termite)<br>*Cryptotermes secundus* (drywood termite)<br>*Coptotermes formosanus* (Formosan subterranean termite) |
| Non-eusocial Blattodea    | *Periplaneta americana* (American cockroach)<br>*Diploptera punctata* (Pacific beetle cockroach) |
| Outgroup                  | *Ischnura elegans* (blue-tailed damselfly)                                  



All eusocial species have clear reproductive and non-reproductive caste systems, whereas their listed non-social relatives lack such division of labor. By surveying OR gene family sizes in each of these taxa, **we aim to determine whether a consistent expansion of OR genes accompanies the evolution of eusociality in both orders.**


# **Motivation**

We started this project because we are interested in insects and gene family evolution. While exploring project ideas, we found several studies on the expansion of odorant receptors in eusocial insects. Eusociality is a fascinating topic because it is a unique way of living that influences the evolution of eusocial species.

Eusocial insects are found in two major groups: Hymenoptera (which includes all ants, some bees, and some wasps) and Blattodea (which includes mostly termites, while non-eusocial species are mostly cockroaches). Previous research suggests a link between eusociality and the expansion of odorant receptors, but most studies focus on Hymenoptera. There has been less research on eusociality in Blattodea. To expand on existing studies, we took a different comparative approach by including a non-Hymenopteran lineage. We specifically focused on the 9-exon family, a well-documented group of odorant receptor genes in Hymenoptera.
